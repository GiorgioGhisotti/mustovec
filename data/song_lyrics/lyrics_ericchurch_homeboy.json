Yeah...\nYou can't hold back the hands of time\nMamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind\nI wish you'd come on back and make it all right\nBefore they're called...home, boy\n\n[Outro]\nHomeboy\nCome on home, boy\nHomeboy\nCome on home, boy", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eafc183f853dc744535edce35a79acdd.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric Church"}
