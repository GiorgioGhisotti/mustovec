Yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nI moved on to another town\nWrote you letters 'til the ink ran out\nWhen the clouds rolled in, I grabbed the keys\nAnd played that song that we used to sing\nI met a boy a lot like you\nIt's funny how he used to sing it, too\nBut he was always just a little out of key\nSo much different than you and me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'\nOh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you think about me\nLike I think about you?\nDo you think about me\nLike I think about you?\nOoh, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes I wonder if you wonder\nWhat it could've been like\nWhen you're sittin' there drinking coffee\nAre you thinkin' of me\nWhen it's thunderin' and rainin' outside?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'\nOh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin'\nOh I, oh I, it's sendin' me flyin'\nOh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you think about me\nLike I think about you?\nDo you think about me\nLike I think about you?\nDo you think about me\nLike I think about you?\nDo you think about me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c6a58564248de03b96f261e9e30c096.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
