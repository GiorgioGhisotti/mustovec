The stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night of our dear Savior's birth\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\nTill He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth\n\nA thrill of hope the weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn\n\nFall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born;\nO night, O Night, O night divine!\nO night, O Night, O night divine!\n\nO Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining\nIt is the night of our dear Savior's birth\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\nTill He appeared and the Soul felt it's worth\nA thrill of hope the weary world rejoices\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn\nFall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born;\nO night divine!\nO night, O night divine!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/df528f0ccf139fe544391a2e3a267d6e.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
