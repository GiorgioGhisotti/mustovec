I keep shooters all around me\nQuicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty\nI got all these haters frontin\u2019 just from lookin\u2019 at my pictures\nPlottin\u2019 on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter\nOn my way home\u2026\nBut I\u2019mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand\u2019ll get you gone\nYou\u2019ll come up missing \u2018cause my cake long\nWhere your real friends at?\nHold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?\nShe probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at\nShe know that you be hatin\u2019 on me and I still hit that, damn\nYou gon\u2019 need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch)\nCancel my account, I\u2019ll probably move the bank\nWhen you see them hammers out you\u2019d best not move a blink\nFN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank\nBitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties\nBitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City\nI be bustin\u2019 bottles, ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 \u2018bout with Drizzy\nProbably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city\nWith yo fake ass, and yo fake weed\nFrontin\u2019 on a real nigga, bitch say cheese\nAnd put your flash on just to catch the AP\nDiamonds thunderin\u2019 all in that bitch, I call it KD\nHold up \u2013 hold up, wait a minute, y\u2019all thought I was finished?\nI popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage\nNigga, you ain\u2019t ballin\u2019, you pop twenty and you finished\nGot you fuckin\u2019 up your re-up every time we in the building\n\u2018Cause we started from the bottom now we here\nSippin\u2019 Ros\u00e9 with Rozay and it\u2019s Belaire\nI signed with MMG and did it in a year\nI started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?\n\n[Intro]\nStill in the basement, where it started\nUhhh...\nStarted from the...\nKells\n\n[Verse 2:Machine Gun Kelly]\nStarted from the bottom, now we here\nCourtside, you would think I was a Cleveland Cavalier\nI\u2019m talking 30,000 feet up in the air\nAnd dance leer, 30 minutes later all the fans cheer, bitch\nYou ain\u2019t seen this power since LeBron\nI went to vegas for my 22nd, rented out the Palms\nNow they say illuminati is the cause\nOr maybe everyone of y\u2019all is lazy and I worked hard\nI ain\u2019t never bowing down for a dollar\nSelling my soul to a charter\nI wouldn\u2019t even take a buck from my father\nBut they weren't saying that back in the day\nWhen I was hustling tickets to my shows, ask dante\nAnd I heard tempers heating up like a filet\nTalking 'bout they run my city when they livin in LA\nSucker, I ain\u2019t hearin nothing bout a word\nTalked about it, been about it, bitch I got what I deserved\nSee I don\u2019t know why everybody mad\nYou had your chance and you blew it\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m young and I\u2019m ruthless\nMeanwhile, the dumb are influenced\nThinking you live like the music\nDon\u2019t be foolish\nMy shooters make your face maroon like the Hoosiers (Braahh)\nSuckers always wanna talk funny\nBroke motherfuckers never wanna talk money\nAnd since I was being quiet in the past\nI\u2019m on the top looking down, kiss my ass\nStill in the game with my same clique\nStill with the hood bitches fuck Cambridge\nAnd when they wanna know if I\u2019m real\nI say \"Bitch I ran my city 'fore I ever had a deal\"\nKells\n\n[Bridge: Drake]\nNo new niggas, nigga we don\u2019t feel that\nFuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?\nWe don\u2019t like to do too much explainin'\nStory stays the same, I never changed it\nNo new niggas, nigga we don\u2019t feel that\nFuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?\nWe don\u2019t like to do too much explainin'\nStory stay the same through the money and the fame\nCause we...\n\n[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]\nCame in the game with no lane and then changed it\nThese fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways\nThen see you and smile in your face\nYou wanna meet up, name a time or a place\nI\u2019m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it\u2019s fire\nYou smell it as soon as I blaze\nBurnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound\nYeah, it\u2019s goin' down, it\u2019s goin' down, it\u2019s goin' down\nStarted from the bottom now we here\nHad a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year\nAll black trucks when we pull up to the Lear\nAll black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I\u2019m steerin'\nHope the homie Drake don\u2019t get pissed\nBut niggas never ever put your man on songs like this\nAnd I probably said no to it before\nBut I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour\nAnd I just seen Waka the other day\nHe wasn\u2019t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'\nCause we\u2026\n\n[Hook:Drake & Wiz Khalifa]\nStarted from the bottom now we're here (Tuh ha ha ha ha)\nStarted from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here (Ugh!)\nStarted from the bottom now we're here\nStarted from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga (Watch it y'all niggas, man, we are doing all this shit)\nStarted from the bottom now we're here (We'all up now)\nStarted from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga\nStarted from the bottom now we're here (Real Shit)\nStarted from the bottom now the whole team fuckin'here\n\n[Outro]\nNo new niggas, nigga we don\u2019t feel that\nFuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?\nWe don\u2019t like to do too much explainin'\nStory stays the same, I never changed it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/84ad5364b68fe10c7405ba894802736d.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
