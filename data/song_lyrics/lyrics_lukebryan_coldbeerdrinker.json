Whiskey burns me up, wine turns my teeth all red\nTequila makes me loco, champagne hurts my head\nBut let me tell you I'm a real big fan, of ice fishing for them aluminum cans\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger\nGot a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll\nI'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger\nKing of the grill and a short putt sinker\nI'm just a cold beer drinker\n\n[Verse 2]\nMonday through 5 o' clock Friday I'm a hardworking man\nResponsible, kind of dull, head-down, stick to the plan\nBut all my buddies know me better than that, get us all together and we start throwing them back\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger\nGot a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll\nI'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger\nKing of the grill and a short putt sinker\nI'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker\n\n[Bridge]\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's the All-American way\nTwist the top off, just to cap off the day, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger\nGot a cooler in the back with a 12 pack raring to go\nDon't you know I'm a killer karaoke country singer\nTop-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger, king of the grill and a short putt sinker\nI'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker.
