You could have picked anybody\nWhy me? When I see you looking at me\nI gotta ask, what did I do\nTo get to be the one you gave your heart to?\nWalk up in a party on my arm\nWho would've thought you would wanna wake up\nEvery day beside me\nBaby, why me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI remember night one\nLooking around for the right one\nSaw you sitting there, said \"Well, I'm done\"\nAnd I walked over\nEven though you were outta my league\nYou were diamonds in the sky\nI was dirt on a plow\nYou're all-American pretty\nI'm a one-horse town\nFirst smile you gave me\nI was thinking it then\nAnd I'm still thinking it now\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy me, out of everybody, baby?\nWhy me? You could have picked anybody\nWhy me? When I see you looking at me\nI gotta ask, what did I do\nTo get to be the one you gave your heart to?\nWalk up in a party on my arm\nWho would've thought you would wanna wake up\nEvery day beside me\nBaby, why me?\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYeah, baby, why me?\nBaby, why me?\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy me? What did I do right?\nWhy me, kissing you goodnight?\nYou say you'll never let me go\nOh, it's crazy girl, I guess I'll never know\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy me, out of everybody, baby?\nWhy me? You could have picked anybody\nWhy me? When I see you looking at me\nI gotta ask, what did I do\nTo get to be the one you gave your heart to?\nWalk up in a party on my arm\nWho would've thought you would wanna wake up\nEvery day beside me\nBaby, why me?\n\n[Outro]\nOh baby, why me?\nBaby, why me?\nBaby, why me?\nBaby, why me?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a2b7c03bfa12987a307b587142d37039.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
