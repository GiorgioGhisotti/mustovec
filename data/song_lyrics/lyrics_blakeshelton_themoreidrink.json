Why can't you just have a few?\"\nHe said, \"I would if I could, but it's probably best that I don't\"\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause the more I drink, the more I drink\nYeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancing machine\nI get loud, I get proud and it gets worse\nWell if I have one, I'll have thirteen\nNow, there aren\u2019t no in-between\n'Cause, the more I drink, the more I drink\n\n[Verse 2]\nA couple of cold ones, and somebody hands me a shot\nHell, even buck-tooth and bow-legged women start looking hot\nAnd pretty soon I'm bumming cigarettes and sweet talking some big brunette\nYeah, once I get on a roll, there aren\u2019t no telling where I'll stop\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the more I drink, the more I drink\nYeah, I'm the world's greatest lover and a dancing machine\nI get loud, I get proud and it gets worse\nWell if I have one, I'll have thirteen\nNow, there aren\u2019t no in-between\nCause, the more I drink, the more I drink\n\n[Bridge]\nYep-yep\nHum, that's what I'm talking about\n\n[Outro]\nMan, if I have one, I'll have thirteen\nAnd they can't get me off the karaoke machine\nThe more I drink the more I drink\nYeah, the more I drink, the more I drink, the more I drink", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d92ab6d2baa4267fa02443f12fd7ce5c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
