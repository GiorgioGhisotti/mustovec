And would we cry together?\nOr would you simply laugh at me and say\n\n[Chorus]\nI told you so, oh, I told you so\nI told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in\nI told you so, but you had to go\nNow I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever\nWould you get down on yours too and take my hand?\nWould we get that old time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?\nThe way we did when our love first began\n\n[Verse 4]\nWould you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?\nAnd you've waited for the day that I returned\nAnd we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only\nOr would you say the tables finally turned?\n\n[Chorus]\nWould you say I told you so? Oh, I told you so\nI told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in\nI told you so, but you had to go\nNow I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again\n\n[Outro]\nNow I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dd95010584b149300e9ec25ef73a6d8b.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
