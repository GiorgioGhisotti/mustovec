Should I be scared?\nYou follow me everywhere, I'm haunted\nCall me crazy, hell, I may be\nBut I believe in ghosts\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, I'm haunted (well, I'm haunted) by a memory (by a memory)\nThat won't leave or let me go\nCall me crazy (call me crazy) and I may be (and I may be)\nBut I believe in ghosts\nGirl, I believe in ghosts\n\n[Outro]\nI've never been superstitious\nI've never feared the unknown\nBut ever since you left me, baby\nI've believed in ghosts", "image": "https://images.genius.com/791c78d67404d5799c52482c231bb361.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jason Aldean"}
