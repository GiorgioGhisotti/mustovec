The fed-up give a damn\nBartender, here's a fifty\nPour some whiskey on this drowning man\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe put the smoke in the stack\nPut the seed in the ground\nWhile Lady Liberty turns her back\nAnd Uncle Sam just turns around\nNo, I don't wanna think about it\nOh, tonight I don't wanna think about it\n\n[Chorus]\nI just wanna get right down at the fire light\nLet my baby sing, \"Hold me tight\nYou honky tonk nighttime man\"\nDrink away this crazy world\nHold tight to a longneck-holdin' girl\nWon't you give it all boys? The fed-up give a damn\nBartender, if you're with me\nPour some whiskey on this drowning man\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus]\nI just wanna get right down at the fire light\nLet my baby sing, \"Hold me tight\nYou honky tonk nighttime man\"\nDrink away this crazy world\nHold tight to a longneck-holdin' girl\nWon't you give it all boys? The fed-up give a damn\nBartender, if you're with me\nPour some whiskey on this drowning man\n\n[Outro]\nDon't tell me about no beach\nDon't wanna hear about your mountain\nHow the good life is a peach\nDrink your sunsets from a fountain\nNo, I don't wanna hear about it\nSave your breath, I don't wanna hear about it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54c8206050910c36c256b33cdd3da339.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric Church"}
