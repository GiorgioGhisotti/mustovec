With stamina to last the night. To be a star in this lady's town...\nYou can f*** or you can fight\n\nYou see, it all comes down to money\nNot romantic art of days gone past, if you forget that rule\nYou can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass\nA tramp, a slut, a bitch, a mutt, a thousand pawn shop guitars\nA nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart\nShe lurks in friendly shadows; but she's a junky with a limp\nThe agents are her bookie and the labels are her pimp\nI'll tell you a well-known secret of a place known far and wide\nThe devil walks among us folks and Nashville is his bride\n\nAll the chaos he has caused, and done\nHis greatest trick is to every guitar-totin' dreamer\nThe devil don't exist... but me, I shook his hand\nAnd I know that he is real\nSo devil, you can go screw yourself, and then go straight to hell\n\nTHE SONG: (Devil, Devil)\n\nDevil, devil, I feel you preying on my mind\nGot nine things going wrong right now\nAnd her leaving makes a dime\nI\u2019m mad as hell, and drunk, and well\nTonight, I guess we\u2019ll see\nIf devil, devil, you\u2019re bad enough to lock horns with me\n\nLevel, level, in search of solid ground\nThis swinging, swaying, side to side, is tossing me around\nI got a hanker for an anchor to steady up my bow\nLevel, level, tie this rebel down\n\nCrazy, crazy, calling out my name\nI got one foot on the platform and the other\u2019s on a train\nSave me, save me, I know what\u2019s in store\nCrazy, crazy hell, I\u2019ve been there before\n\nDanger, danger, the way you\u2019re looking there at me\nBe careful what you wish for, you might get what you don\u2019t need\nI\u2019m a brush fire on a drought land in a Santa Ana breeze\nDanger, danger, don\u2019t you play around with me\n\nCrazy, crazy, calling out my name\nI got one foot on the platform and the other\u2019s on a train\nSave me, save me, I know what\u2019s in store\nCrazy, crazy hell, I\u2019ve been there before\n\nAngel, angel, heavenly body in holy jeans\nOn second thought, get over here and wrap me in your wings\nThrow caution to the wind and honey, give me what I need\nAngel, angel, love this devil, devil, out of me\nDevil, devil, devil\n\nOooooo, devil, devil\nOooooo, devil, devil\nOooooo, devil, devil", "image": "https://images.genius.com/47a32fe3674c4d1c09293941f678d2e9.315x315x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric Church"}
