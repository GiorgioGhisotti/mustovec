(Oh, oh, oh)\nI never said that I want this\nThis burden came to me\nAnd it's made its home inside (Oh, oh, oh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I told you what I was\nWould you turn your back on me?\nAnd if I seemed dangerous\nWould you be scared?\nI get the feeling just because\nEverything I touch isn't dark enough\nThat this problem lies in me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm only a man with a candle to guide me\nI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me\nA monster, a monster\nI've turned into a monster\nA monster, a monster\nAnd it keeps getting stronger\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm only a man with a candle to guide me\nI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me\nA monster, a monster\nI've turned into a monster\nA monster, a monster\nAnd it keeps getting stronger", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5a126a13f2549ef7f58b7a420bd09368.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
