Put gas in the car?\nDon't think you need too much, 'cause you ain't gonna get that far\nDid you pack the good times?\nDon't forget a map\nJust incase the route you take isn't there to take you back\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can hold any girl that you like\nFall in love when it's easy at night\nBut you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better\nWhen you're lost and you run out of road\nFind what I already know\nIn the end, close is all there is\nBut you won't find this\nNo, you won't find this\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's once in a lifetime\nAnd there's once in a while\nAnd the difference between the two is about a million miles\nOh, you might get lucky while the moon is looking up\nBut in the truth of the morning, the stars will be long gone\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can hold any girl that you like\nFall in love when it's easy at night\nBut you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better\nWhen you're lost and you run out of road\nFind what I already know\nIn the end, close is all there is\nBut you won't find this\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can hold any girl that you like\nFall in love when it's easy at night\nBut you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better\nWhen you're lost and you run out of road\nFind what I already know\nIn the end, close is all there is\nOh, in the end, it's me you're going to miss\n'Cause you won't find this\nOh, you won't find this", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8cd90fdf5d2de77f1592270ebdf41bcb.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
