Am I out of my place?\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space\nOh, I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone\n\n[Refrain]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved\n\n[Break]\nThat I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved\nThat I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved, That I loved, that I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through\n\n[Verse 2]\nAm I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape\nOh, I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted\n\n[Refrain]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the meantime, we let it go\nAt the road sign we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nOh, we let this drift away\nAt the bay side, we used to show\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nOh, we let this drift away\nAnd there's always time to change your mind\nAnd there's always time to change your mind\nOh, love, can you hear me?\nAnd there's always time to change your mind\nAnd there's always time to change your mind\nOh, love, can you hear me?\nOh, let it drift away\n\n[Break]\nOh, let it drift away\nShot, shot, shot a hole through, through, through, through...\nOh, let it drift away\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f7009fd4e43503eec461012e8678eb89.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
