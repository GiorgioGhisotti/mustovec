Why don't you do it, baby?\nYou can't tell me that we'll still be friends\nAnd maybe someday we can try again\nIf you really need a brand new start\nWhy don't you go ahead and break my heart?\n\n[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]\nI'd never ever meant to get so into you\nThought I was using you just to get me through\nYou know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone\nLast thing I needed was to fall in love\nYou've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope\nThere is nobody else I wanna get to know\nBut I'm so scared, I don't know what to do\nHow did you get me so into you?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]\nOh no, here I go\n\n[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]\nWhy don't you go ahead and break my heart?\nWhy are you waiting, is it way too hard?\nIf moving on is what you wanna do\nWhy don't you do it? Why don't you do it, baby?\nYou can't tell me that we'll still be friends\nAnd maybe someday we can try again\nIf you really need a brand new start\nWhy don't you go ahead and break my heart?\n\n[Bridge: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]\nThere's your reasons\nThere's your cards\nWhat are you waiting for?\nThe one to break my heart\n\n[Outro: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani]\nYeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends\nAnd maybe someday we can try again\nIf you really need a brand new start\nWhy don't you go ahead and break my heart?\nOh, go on and break, go on and break my heart\nGo on and break, go on and break my heart", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7caa51a6e88787c8138c18a8702c566e.620x620x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
