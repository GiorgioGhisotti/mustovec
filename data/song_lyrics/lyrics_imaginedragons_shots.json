Am I out of my place\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?\nOh, I'm wishin' you're here\nBut I'm wishin' you're gone\n\n[Refrain]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up\nOh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough every single thing that I loved\n\n[Verse 2]\nAm I out of luck? Am I waiting to break\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape?\nOh, I'm wishin' I had\nWhat I'm takin' for granted\n\n[Refrain]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up\nOh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough every single thing that I loved\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the meantime, we let it go\nAt the roadside we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nOh, we let this drift away\nAt the bay side, we used to show\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nOh, we let this drift away\nAnd there's always time to change your mind\nAnd there's always time to change your mind\nOh, love, can you hear me?\nOh, let it drift away\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)\nThrough every single thing that I loved\n(Let me make it up to you)\n\n[Outro]\nIn the meantime, we let it go\nAt the roadside we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nOh, we let this drift away\nAt the bay side, we used to show\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nOh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)\n'Cause you've always got to change your mind\n'Cause you've always got to change your mind\nOh, love, can you hear me?\nOh, let it drift away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3fd16bc747e8a3708b689c93eae42972.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
