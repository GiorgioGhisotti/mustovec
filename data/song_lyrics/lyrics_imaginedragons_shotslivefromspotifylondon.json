Am I outta my place\nWhen I keep sayin' that I\u2019m lookin' for an empty space?\nOh, wishin' you\u2019re here\nBut I'm wishin' you're gone\n\n[Refrain]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'ma mess this up\nOh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over agai-ai-ain\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I\u2019ve done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nThen I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough every single thing that I loved\n\n[Break]\nWhoa, yeah\nCome on\n\n[Verse 2]\nAm I out of luck? Am I waiting to break\nWhen I keep sayin\u2019 that I'm lookin\u2019 for a way to escape?\nOh, I'm wishin' I had\nWhat I've taken for granted\n\n[Refrain]\nI can\u2019t have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up\nOh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nAnd then I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough everything I loved\nOh, I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough every single thing that I loved\n\n[Bridge]\nWhoa, in the meantime, we let it go\nAt the roadside we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nLet this drift away\nAt the bayside, we used to show\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nLet this drift away\nThere's always time to change your mind\nThere's always time to change your mind\nOh, love, can you hear me?\nOh, let it drift away-ay-ay\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done\nFrom the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun\nThen I shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough everything I loved\nOh, shot, shot, shot a hole\nThrough every single thing that I loved\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the meantime, we let it go\nAt the roadside that we used to know\nWe can let this drift away\nLet this drift away\nAt the bayside, we used to show\nIn the moonlight, we let it go\nWe can let this drift away\nLet this drift away\nThere's always time to change your mind\nThere's always time to change your mind\nOh, love, can you hear me?\nOh, let it drift away\n\n[Outro]\nOh!\nOo-oo-ooh\nThank you\nThank you so much", "image": "https://images.genius.com/825f6a8c0ed238ee903217c5be2f010d.770x770x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
