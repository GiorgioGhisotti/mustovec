What have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know my last name\n\n[Breakdown]\nWhat have I done?\nWhat have I done?\nWhat have I done?\nOh, what have I done?\nI don't even know my last name\nWell, it turned into, \"Oh no, what have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know my last name\nHey, yeah, yeah\nYeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nIt started off, \"Hey cutie, where you from?\"\nAnd then it turned into, \"Oh no, what have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know my last name\nOh, yeah", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1a08de1d34b6c158639f177feeb944d7.318x314x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
