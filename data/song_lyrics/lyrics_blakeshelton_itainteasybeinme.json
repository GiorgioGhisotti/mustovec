Am I a self-made fool?\nI shoot the lights and I curse the dark\nI need your love but I break your heart\nAnd I know the words that'll bring you back\nBut I don't say nothing' as I watch you pack\nI had to work to be the jerk I've come to be\nIt ain't easy being' me\n\n[Verse 2]\nOught to be a side show act for freaks like me\nYeah I could be the star of the show\nWith my name on the marquee\nIn a room with a big red button that says \"Danger: Do Not Touch\"\nAnd twice a day I'd mash it down\nAnd you could watch me self-destruct\n\n[Chorus]\nWhy do I do the things I do?\nWas I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?\nI shoot the lights and I curse the dark\nI need your love but I break your heart\nAnd I know the words that'll bring you back\nBut I don't say nothing' as I watch you pack\nI had to work to be the jerk I've come to be\nIt ain't easy being' me\nIt ain't easy being me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d92ab6d2baa4267fa02443f12fd7ce5c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
