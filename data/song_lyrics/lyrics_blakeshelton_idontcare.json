I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye\nAnd I came real close and almost lost my temper\nBut I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't care, she don't matter\nI don't love her anymore, he can have her\nI don't know why it slips my mind, I tell myself all the time\nGuess I forgot again, for a second there, that I don't care\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlmost 10:00... should've known his car would still be parked in her drive\nAlmost pulled in... knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind\nOh, but I just kept on drivin' back to my place\nWonderin' why I went so far out of my way, when...\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't care, she don't matter\nI don't love her anymore, he can have her\nI don't know why it slips my mind, I tell myself all the time\nGuess I forgot again, for a second there, that I don't care\n\n[Bridge]\nI got home the light was blinkin' on that old machine\nShe said, \"My brother's been in town, but he just left, and I miss you. Give me a ring\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI still care, she's all that matters\nI still love her just like always, gotta have her\nI never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime\nI know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care\nI don't care", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d92ab6d2baa4267fa02443f12fd7ce5c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
