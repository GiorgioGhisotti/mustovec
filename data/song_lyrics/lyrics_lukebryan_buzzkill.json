Here to Party", "year": "2013-03-05", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou're like a screen flashing, insufficient funds\nCops knocking when the party's just begun\nYou're a big rain cloud parked over my boat\nYou're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup\nA fumble on the one when my team was going up\nYou're like brakes on my brain and all I know\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're a buzzkill, every time you come around\nThose beers might as well have been poured out\nWhy are you still showing up and bringing me down?\nWhy do I keep letting you get to me\nAnd mess up what this night was going to be?\nYou walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will\nYou little buzzkill\nBaby, you're a buzzkill\n\n[Verse 2]\nI used to do everything I could do to do nice things\nNo matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change\nEverybody knows you ended us\nSo why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?\nSlipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at\nI was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're a buzzkill, every time you come around\nThose beers might as well have been poured out\nWhy are you still showing up and bringing me down?\nWhy do I keep letting you get to me\nAnd mess up what this night was going to be?\nYou walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will\nYou little buzzkill\nBaby, you're a buzzkill\n\n[Verse 3]\nAs if it didn't hurt enough, now I got to see you flirt\nNailed to the stool, watching you work\nDon't you give a damn about how I feel\nYou little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYou're such a buzzkill\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're a buzzkill, every time you come around\nThose beers might as well have been poured out\nWhy are you still showing up and bringing me down?\nWhy do I keep letting you get to me\nAnd mess up what this night was going to be?\nYou walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will\nYou little buzzkill\nBaby, you're a buzzkill", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9931d7366fcea05dfade6d727f83db11.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
