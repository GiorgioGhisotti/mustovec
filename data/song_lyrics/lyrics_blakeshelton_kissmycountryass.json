Aw yeah!\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\nAw yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, there's a whole lot of high-class people out there\nThat's looking down on me\nCause the country club where I belong\nIs the Honky Tonk till three in the morning\nDon't wear no fancy clothes\nNo ties or three piece suits\nYou can find me in my camouflage cap\nMy t-shirt and cowboy boots\nIf that don't fit your social class\nYou can kiss my country ass\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're a down home, backwoods redneck\nHey, come on, stand up and raise your glass\nBut if you aren\u2019t down with my outlaw crowd\nYou can kiss my country ass\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell I'm a front-porch sitting\nGuitar picking, moonshine sipping\nBacker juice spitting country boy from the woods\nAnd I love fried chicken & blue gill fishing\nAnd outlaw women, an' I wouldn't change if I could. NO!\nI aren\u2019t trying to start no fight, but I'll finish one every time\nSo you just mind your own damn business\nStay the hell outta mine\nIf you got a problem with that\nYou can kiss my country ass\n\nI said if you got a problem with any of that\nYou can kiss my natural born, Redneck to the bone\nEver-loving country ass", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d693eb3c3bc97f9acf66fec528eb1e41.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
