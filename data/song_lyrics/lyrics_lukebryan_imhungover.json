Hangover Edition", "year": null, "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nGrabbed my phone, rolled outta bed\nWent back through all the texts I sent\nHalf-drunk beer on my nightstand\nAnd a red club stamp on my right hand\nTripped on my boots walking down the hall\nChugging sink water, staring at the wall\nTrying to put the pieces back together again\nWho did how, what, where and when?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh hell yeah my head hurts\nI got whiskey and lip gloss on my new shirt\nAll I know is we went out and done it up right\nI rode a bull, did a keg stand, shot gunned a beer can, jumped in and broke up a fight\nNow it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think I left my debit card at the bar\nThink I took a kiss a little too far\nWho's that sleeping on my couch?\nI got to whole lot of drunk drama left to sort out\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\nOh hell yeah my head hurts\nNow that I come to think about it this aren\u2019t my shirt\nAll I know is I went out and done it up right\nGot in a fight with my girlfriend, threw down my beer can, and still had the time of my life\nNow it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, yeah now it's Saturday morning, I'm hangover, but damn what a Friday night\nMan what a Friday night", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4297ba84e39c9d596b27643015b95323.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
