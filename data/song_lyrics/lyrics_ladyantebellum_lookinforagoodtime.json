Oh yeah\n\nChorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nGo ahead and lie to me and pull me close\nTell me that you love me even if you don't\nThe rule is don't you ever even talk about forever\nBut you never say never in life\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nHey I'm just looking for a good time", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de692c16958d86d074a68d20fb467132.220x220x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Antebellum"}
