Am I still enough?\nTell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nGive you everything that you ever wanted?\nWould you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?\nDo I just need to give up and get on with my life?\nBaby, do I?\n\n[Verse 2]\nRemember when we didn't have nothing\nBut a perfect simple kind of loving?\nBaby, those sure were the days\nThere was a time our love ran wild and free\nBut now I'm second guessing everything I see!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?\nDoes the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?\nDo I have your love? Am I still enough?\nTell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nGive you everything that you ever wanted?\nWould you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?\nDo I just need to give up and get on with my life?\n\n[Verse 3]\nBaby, do I still give you what you need?\nStill take your breath away?\nLight up the spark way down deep?\nBaby, do I?!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhoa! Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?\nDoes the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?\nDo I have your love? Am I still enough?\nTell me, don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nGive you everything that you ever wanted?\nWould you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?\nDo I just need to give up and get on with my life?\nTell me baby, do I get one more try? Do I?\nBaby, do I?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8e90c5a21ff37436ac5bf08ea1a7f5b6.280x280x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
