Oh, wo-a-oh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nLooking to the lonely telegraph that crept into your room\nListen to the bleeding voices of the ones around her tomb\n\n[Refrain]\nThe radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing\nThe people all explaining, but they don't know a thing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGive me a sign, give me a sign\nI wanna die tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say that London sounds like a city of red\nAll the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead\nOh, you don't love me\nYou don't love me like you say you do\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can take a picture, you can be a picture\nStitched into the fading black\nI can take you home, now you can be a home\nAnd we'll never look on back\n\n[Refrain]\nThe radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing\nThe people all explaining, but they don't know a thing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGive me a sign, give me a sign\nI wanna die tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say that London sounds like a city of red\nAll the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead\nOh, You don't love me\nYou don't love me like you say you do\nOh, London sounds like a city of red\nAll the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead\nAnd I don't want to die\nNo, I don't want to die\nTonight\n\n[Bridge]\nCome out, I'm waiting on your front porch\nYou came in from the back door\nAnd we drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters\nClouds above us crying tears of sins all dying\nWe're begging for a reason\nOh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!\nOh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!\n\n[Outro]\nNow, come out, I'm waiting on your front porch\nYou came in from the back door\nWe drift along a flooded sea of muddy waters\nClouds above us crying tears of sins all dying\nWe're begging for a reason\nThis year seems like a season\nBelief in how we're living\nStory with no ending\nThe storm is beating down\nBut we're sinking to the sky\nWe're sinking to the sky\nWe're sinking to the sky\nWe're sinking to the sky", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e85b544006c8d002bb5d2fb71056e7a.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
