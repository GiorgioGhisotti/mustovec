Glory! Hallelujah. You've made it easy for the both of us\"\nIf he's got a chest and some arms\nHe'll hear me singing you\n\"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah. You've made it easy for the both of us\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHey, you got all the money, honey\nYour eyes are looking runny and red\nHey, you think all your friends are funny\nBut all your friends are way overfed\n\n[Post Chorus]\nIf you've got to go, I won't stop you\nYou'll hear me singing you\n\"Glory!
