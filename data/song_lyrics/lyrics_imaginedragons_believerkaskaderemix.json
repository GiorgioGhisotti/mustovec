You made me a, you made me a believer, believer\nPain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nAll the words inside my\nBeliever\nYou break me down you build me up, believer\nPain\nAll the words inside my\nBeliever\nYou break me down you build me up, believer\nPain\n\n[Verse 2]\nThird things third\nSend a prayer to the ones up above\nAll the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh\nYour spirit up above, oh-ooh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was choking in the crowd\nLiving my brain up in the cloud\nFalling like ashes to the ground\nHoping my feelings, they would drown\nBut they never did, ever lived\nEbbing and flowing, inhibited, limited\nTill it broke open and it rained down\nIt rained down, like...\n\n[Chorus]\nPain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer\nPain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer\n\n[Outro]\nAll the words inside my\nBeliever\nYou break me down you build me up, believer\nPain\nAll the words inside my\nBeliever\nYou break me down you build me up, believer\nPain", "image": "https://images.genius.com/34373b07f8d6b2f277abde6221c9e625.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
