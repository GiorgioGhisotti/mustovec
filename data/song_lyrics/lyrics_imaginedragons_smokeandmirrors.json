(Mirrors, mirrors)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll that I've known, buildings of stone\nFall to the ground without a sound\nThis is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper\nI'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there\nI'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame\nI wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain\nTo disappear, dream maker, life taker\nOpen up my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I believe, is it a dream\nThat comes crashing down on me?\nAll that I hope\nIs it just smoke and mirrors?\nI want to believe, whoa\nBut all that I know\nIs it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)\n\n[Bridge]\nBelieve\nI want to believe\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I believe, is it a dream\nThat comes crashing down on me?\nAll that I hope\nIs it just smoke and mirrors?\nI want to believe, whoa\nBut all that I know\nIs it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)\n\n[Outro Guitar Solo]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bec97ed77eb1389aaa917de39ed715a4.736x736x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
