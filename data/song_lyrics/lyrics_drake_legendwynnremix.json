I know I, been the cos greatest blessings\n\n[Verse 1]\nDidn't recognize a king when he rappin with you\nYou always suck it like you always bring a vacuum with you\nSounded like a man that canpachine plastic gives you\nCause if you got up on a pick, I got imagine issue\n\n[Pre-Hook]\nTalking about me then it got a be lies\nCause I never get a tag or a chance to reply\nIf you don't got the courage to answer me\nThen you could fuck yourself, but you would fall until the battery dies\nI mean you're mad at me why? Cause I had to be fly\nTwo albums in a year and I can't even try\nTried to fill my shoes that you had to re size\nI'm the king, I'm the throne, bitches where I was at\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I pull up on a hater watch a hater fall back\nI'm too good with these hands, watch a hater fall flat\nIf I die, all I know I'm a mothafuckin' legend\nIt's so great for my city, I'm the realist one that's rappin\n\n[Hook]\nOh my God, oh my God\nIf I die, I'm a legend\nWhen they made me down the rest, I know I was always rappin\nOh my God, my whole life, my words been ma greatest weapon\nI know I.
