Am I out of my place?\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space\nOh, I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nAm I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?\nWhen I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape\nOh, I'm wishin' I had what I've takin' for granted\n\n[Chorus]\nI can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong\nOh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck\nOver and over and over again\n\n[Break]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b69e0b045848652c5d95c58616a06012.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
