Nobody knows\nShe's all cried out on the kitchen floor\nSpinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control\nSpinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's in a hotel room with the TV on\nGettin' lost in the static with the curtains drawn\nKnowin' this could be the time that gets her gone for good\nHe'd quit if he could\nBut one down, two down, three down, four\nCan't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, 'round and around and around they go\nWill it end? Nobody knows\nHe's passed out on the bathroom floor\nSpinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control\nSpinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles\n\n[Bridge]\nThis ain't a game\nNobody wins\nYeah, nobody gets lucky when that bottle spins\nAgain and again, again and again, again and again\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, 'round and around and around they go\nWill this end? Nobody knows\nCan't live like this anymore\nSpinnin' rooms, spinnin' wheels, spinnin' out of control\nSpinnin' bottles, spinnin' bottles\nYeah, spinnin' bottles\nSpinnin' bottles", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13c7a612dd4e264983bb1f4c7b70d5ce.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
