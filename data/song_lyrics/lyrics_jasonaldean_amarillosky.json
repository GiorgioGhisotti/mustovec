(Another round)\nAnother round (Another round), another round\nAnd he takes the tractor another round, another round\nHe says, \"I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'\nPlease do not let my dreams run dry\nUnderneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky\"\n\"Underneath this Amarillo Sky\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/9db6cba5ed9cae2f766e36c2ae778766.220x215x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jason Aldean"}
