Yeah\nA little smoother ride? Maybe so\nBut lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?\nNo\n\n[Verse 2]\nI believe things happen for a reason\nEven though you might not see it at the time\n'Cause now I know\nEvery plan that came unraveled\nEvery crooked path I traveled in my life\nLed me here to your side\n\n[Chorus]\nCould have been easier? Yeah\nA little smoother ride? Maybe so\nBut lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?\nNo\n\n[Bridge]\nYeah, I finally found you\n\n[Outro]\nCould it have been easier? Yeah\nA little smoother ride? Maybe so\nBut lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?\nIt could've been easier, yeah\nA little smoother ride, maybe so\nBut lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?\nNo", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97eceff7c74b8f07707fa79a9dd79287.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jason Aldean"}
