Wow! Wow!\n\n[Verse 2]\nCopperhead said to the rattlesnake\n\"If you ever wanna make it rain\nWe could team up, be twice as tough\nFear will be our game\"\nRattlesnake said to the copperhead\n\"Y'know we were the original sin\nAnd I bet you my rattle against your copper\nThat the bitch takes the apple again\"\n\n[Chorus]\nRattlesnake, copperhead\nEither one of them'll kill you dead\nWe stay hungry, they get fed\nAnd don't pass the plate around\nLie by lie, cheat by cheat\nVenom in smiling teeth\nThey just run those forked tongues\nAnd the whole world's burning down\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWow! Wow! Wow!\n\n[Outro]\nRattlesnake said to the copperhead\n\"Ain't no way they'd win\n'Cause the mice are sheep and the shepherd's asleep\"\nAnd the copperhead said, \"Amen\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/54c8206050910c36c256b33cdd3da339.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric Church"}
