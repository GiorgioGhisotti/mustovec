{"songs": [{"title": "Do You Wish It Was Me", "album": "Relentless", "year": "2007-05-29", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen the sun slowly chases the moon from the sky\nAnd touches your face as you open your eyes\nWhat are you thinkin'? Do you like what you see?\nIs it all that you dreamed of or do you wish it was me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIs the life that you've chosen free from regret?\nOr is what might have been just too hard to forget?\nHas the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?\nAre you satisfied, baby, or do you wish it was me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you that did what you thought you should do\nIt was safe and secure, so completely thought through\nBut you sacrificed passion and abandoned your dreams\nBaby, was it all worth it or do you wish it was me?\n\n[Bridge]\nDoes each kiss seem closer to the first or the last?\nIs the fire still ragin' or has it burned down to ash?\nDo the memories haunt you? Do they beg and they pled?\nAre you satisfied, baby, or do you wish it was me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIs the life that you've chosen free from regret?\nOr is what might have been just to hard to forget?\nHas the glitter all faded? Do you get what you need?\nAre you satisfied, baby, or do you wish it was me?\n\n[Outro]\nAre you satisfied baby?\nMmm, yeah\nOr do you wish it was me?\nDo you wish it was me?\nOh, do you wish it was me?\nDo you wish it was me?\nDo you wish it was me?\nYeah, do you wish it was me?\nWhoa-oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97eceff7c74b8f07707fa79a9dd79287.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jason Aldean"}
