She is gone and found her way\nTo another life in a better place\nBut I hear she is missing me\nYou will can have this town\n\n[Verse 2]\nBet there is not a single place to fish up there\nNo small talk or sweet tea, but I do not care\nIt is going to be worth everything I have to leave\nWhen I feel her loving arms on me\nRight there is the Interstate\nAnd I am turning on\nLooks like I am gone\n\n[Chorus]\n\nEverybody says I will be back\nBrother do not hold your breath on that\nBecause as long as she is not here\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/75be00ced42adde0425d63d7a6194a48.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
