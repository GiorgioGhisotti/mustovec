I've been a zombie\nI'm feeling like I've been locked in a grave\nYou were the laugh, you were the life, you were the party\nYou were the brave, I was the weak, you were the army\nYou were the faith, you were the truth, I was the sorry\nI'm feeling like you've been taken away\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were my one, you were my one\nWhen all has been said, all has been done\nYou were my one, you were my one\nNow I am left reaching above me, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nTime goes by and still I am stuck on you\nOoh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)\nYeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you\nOoh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy did you leave? Why did you go leaving me lonely?\nDidn't you know you were the home, you were the only?\nWhere did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?\nCome back to me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou were my one, you were my one\nWhen all has been said, all has been done\nYou were my one, you were my one\nNow I am left reaching above me, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nTime goes by and still I am stuck on you\nOoh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)\nTime goes by and still I am stuck on you\nOoh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)\nTime goes by and still I am stuck on you\nYeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, stuck on you\nOh, oh, oh, woah (Woah-oh, woah, oh)\nOh, oh, oh\nAs time goes by, as time goes by, woah\nTime goes by and still I am stuck on you\nOoh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)\nTime goes by and still I am stuck on you\nOoh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/10acb196a240ef1d986b8ab286ff26e8.905x905x1.png"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
