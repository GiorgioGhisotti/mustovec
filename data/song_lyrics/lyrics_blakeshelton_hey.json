And what do they say\nThey say hey, hey\nPark that Deere, come out and play\nKick that tire, wipe my perspire\nBecause my whole life is hay\n\n[Chorus]\nGrowing like weeds, stick out your teeth\nPlaying underneath the baby Jesus\nBlowing out the truck, heading down the highway\nLooking pretty soft up in the loft\nCome on baby kick your cowgirls off\nI'm picking you up after I draw my pay\nAnd we'll be Rolling in the hay\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey, hey, Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet\nDifferent strokes for different folks\nA little fella walks up in a pink beret\nHe says \"Hey\" - Hey, hell that's OK\nTurn the guitars up and raise them cups\nHell my whole life is hay\n\n[Chorus]\nGrowing like weeds, stick out your teeth\nPlaying underneath the baby Jesus\nBlowing out the truck, heading down the highway\nLooking pretty soft up in the loft\nCome on baby kick your cowgirls off\nI'm picking you up after I draw my pay\nAnd we'll be Rolling in the hay\n\n[Verse 3]\nPut it on a flatbed and go for a ride\nUnder the moonlight, you by my side\nGive it to the cow, make it go moo\nKoo-koo-kachoo, kick it off your shoe\nBreak a camel's back, jack\nThen you put it in a stack yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nGrowing like weeds, stick out your teeth\nPlaying underneath the baby Jesus\nBlowing out the truck, heading down the highway\nLooking pretty soft up in the loft\nCome on baby kick your cowgirls off\nI'm picking you up after I draw my pay\nAnd we'll be Rolling in the hay\n\n[Outro]\nMy whole life is hay\nRolling in the hay\nHey!\nNow come here, hey, hey\nHey!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/17246718f3ae9da724372ef9a9c3b04c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
