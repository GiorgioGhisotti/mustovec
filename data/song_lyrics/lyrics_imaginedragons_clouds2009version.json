Oh, wo-a-oh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy calloused hands\nMy crippled wings\nMy calloused hands, my crippled wings, they bring you in\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky\nThey'll turn to clouds, woah\nA sky of hands that rains down heavy on us\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes\nI never said it, never said it, oh surprise\nCome on let it, let it move, let it move, move\nLet it, let it, let it move, let it move\nOh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes\nI never said it, never said it, oh surprise\nCome on let it, let it move, let it move, move\nSpeak, speak, speak, speak to me\nLet it go\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour scribbled masterpiece\nAnd written poetry\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky\nThey'll turn to clouds, woah\nA sky of hands that rains down heavy on us\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes\nI never said it, never said it, oh surprise\nCome on let it, let it move, let it move, move\nLet it, let it, let it move, let it move\nOh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes\nI never said it, never said it, oh surprise\nCome on let it, let it move, let it move, move\nSpeak, speak, speak, speak to me\nLet it go\n\n[Bridge]\nCome out I'm waiting on your front porch\nYou came in from the back door\nDrift along a flooded\nSea of muddy waters\nClouds above us crying\nTears of sins all dying\nBegging for a reason\nOh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!\nOh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh! Oh, no\nOh, come out I'm waiting on your front porch\nYou came in from the back door\nDrift along a flooded\nSea of muddy waters\nClouds above us crying\nTears of sins all dying\nBegging for a reason\nYear seems like a season\nBelief in how we're living\nA story with no ending\nThe storm is beating down\n\n[Outro]\nWe're sinking to the sky\nSinking to the sky\nWe're sinking to the sky\nSinking to the sky\nAh!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e85b544006c8d002bb5d2fb71056e7a.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
