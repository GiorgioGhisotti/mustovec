We're all drinking again\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nNobody wants to leave\nSomebody put it on my card\nDeclined? Alright, here's another\nAlright\nHow'd we wind up here?\nWho brought us here?\nSame time, same place tomorrow!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b361a936bd2a5d2f8a90d460513bb0b6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
