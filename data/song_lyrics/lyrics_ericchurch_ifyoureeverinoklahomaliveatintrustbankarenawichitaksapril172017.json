Texas\nJust wanna get to Wichita\nIf you're ever in Oklahoma\nYou better move around the law\n\nThey got fines and they got plenty\nAnd they'll old ya up for days on end\nThreaten your life take your money\nMake you think you're at the end\n\nThey don't care 'bout Dallas. Texas\nJust wanna get to Wichita\nIf you're ever in Oklahoma\nYou better move around the law\n\nYeah they don't care 'bout Dallas. Texas\nAnd they don't care 'bout Wichita\nIf you're ever in Oklahoma\nYou better move around the law\n\nYeah and they don't care 'bout Dallas. Texas\nAnd they don't care 'bout Wichita\nIf you're ever in Oklahoma\nYou better move around the law", "image": "https://images.genius.com/13bd2ef47182f9257a9b9998def692a9.224x224x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric Church"}
