B. King\nSlide a fastball past Hank Aaron\nBatter, batter, batter swing\nI can do most anything\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know that it's God's decision\nWhat my heaven's going to be\nAnd I aren\u2019t telling him his business\nBut if he left it up to me\n\n[Outro]\nThen in my heaven\nThere's football with no referees\nIn my heaven\nThere's never been an injury\nIn my heaven\nAngels yodel when they sing\nIn my heaven\nThe fish will bite most anything\nIn my heaven\nIn my heaven\nIn my heaven", "image": "https://images.genius.com/a852cd072093478d701eb7ddddd28a28.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Blake Shelton"}
