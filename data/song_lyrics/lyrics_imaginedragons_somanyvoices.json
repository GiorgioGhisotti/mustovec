What would I burn?\nI am a pawn within your hands\nSo many voices\nSo many voices\n\n[Verse 3]\nLeavin' my youth, leavin' my truth\nCarvin' in my blood into the stone\nLesser of two, either you lose\nOr you come out and be alone\nSo many voices\nThere's so many choices\nSo many voices\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat do I do? Where do I turn?\nEven my screams cease to be heard\nLesser of two\nEither you lose\nOr you are bound to be alone\nSo many choices", "image": "https://images.genius.com/cd59780cda52cfcb8126e654677d62fb.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
