(For me)\nFor me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, give me strength, and give me peace\nDoes anyone out there want to hear me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you\nIt's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you\nDon't burn out, don't burn out on me\nDon't burn out, don't burn out on me\n\n[Verse 2]\nSadness is my enemy\nI fear time will age him gently\nWalking by my side for all these years\nSeems that we've grown friendly\nHappiness is beautiful to see\nWon't you box it up for me? (For me)\nFor me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, give me strength, and give me peace\nDoes anyone out there want to hear me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you\nIt's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you\nDon't burn out, don't burn out on me\nDon't burn out, don't burn out on me\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's just another downpour\nIt's just another downpour\nI won't give up\nI won't give up\nI won't give up\nI won't\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you\nIt's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you\nI don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go\nDon't burn out, don't burn out on me\nI don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go\nDon't burn out, don't burn out on me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/10acb196a240ef1d986b8ab286ff26e8.905x905x1.png"}], "artist": "Imagine Dragons"}
