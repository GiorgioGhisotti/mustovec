I'll be weak!\n\nPlease celebrate me home, give me a number\nPlease celebrate me home, play me one more song\nThat I'll always remember\nThat I can recall whenever I find myself too alone\nI can make you believe that I'm never gone\nBaby, let me know where I belong\nSing me home!\n\nPlay me one more song, hmm\n\nWell I'm finally here, but I'm bound to roam\nC'mon celebrate me home\nWell I'm finally here, but I'm bound to roam\nCelebrate me home\nWell I'm finally here, but I'm bound to roam\nC'mon celebrate me home (Give me a number)\nWell I'm finally here, but I'm bound to roam\nC'mon celebrate me home (Give me a number please)\n\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\nCelebrate me, celebrate me home\nPlease, celebrate me home!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b73ceb3acf93c437a8850626827cf34c.400x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Antebellum"}
