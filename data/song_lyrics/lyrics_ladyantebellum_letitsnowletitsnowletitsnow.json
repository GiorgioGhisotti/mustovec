Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt doesn't show signs of stopping\nAnd I've bought some corn for popping\nThe lights are turned way down low\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm!\nBut if you'll really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\n[Chorus]\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd, my dear, we're still good-bying\nBut as long as you love me so\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\nLet It Snow! Let It Snow!
