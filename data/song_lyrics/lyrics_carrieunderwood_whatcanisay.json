What can I say?\nWhat can I say? What can I say?\n\n[Verse 3: Carrie Underwood & Ashley Clark]\nI hate to think all you had of me\n(I said all I had to say)\nIs a memory I left you\nThe space between what was meant to be\n(In letters that I threw away)\nAnd the mess that it turned into\n\n[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Ashley Clark, Both]\nAnd you should know, please believe me\nI've picked up the phone a thousand times\nAnd tried to dial your number\nBut it's been so long, it's never easy\nIt's like trying to spin the world the other way\nIt is like trying to spin the world the other way\nWhat can I say?\nWhat can I say?\nWhat can I say?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/adceeeb4e2577c67b43b3dfc9bda832e.900x900x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
