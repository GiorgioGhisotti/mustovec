Baby we can work this out\nA dust trail from a Greyhound headed for the West Coast\nAs I watch you leave, it's gettin' hard to breathe\nNo this ain't how it was supposed to be\nIf you're out chasing all your dreams\nTell me where does that leave me\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about the plans that you left behind\nThe little white house by the railway line\nThe one we picked out\nWe even put the payment down\nWhat about the promise that you made\nTo stay with me till your dying day\nSaid you'd never go away\nAre they just things that people say?\nAre they just things, baby?\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe preacher stopped by the house last Tuesday\nAsked if I was fine\nWe sat and talked a while, he tried to make me smile\nBut it's so hard to show my face round lately\nIn this small town\nI guess they heard the news about me and you\nIt's three a.m. and I can't sleep at all\nI wonder where you are tonight\nAnd do I ever cross your mind?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about the plans that you left behind\nThe little white house by the railway line\nThe one we picked out\nWe even put the payment down\nWhat about the promise that you made\nTo stay with me till your dying day\nSaid you'd never go away\nAre they just things that people say?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell my momma won't stop crying\nShe wonders what went wrong\nCould I have loved a little deeper?\nOr did I hold on too strong?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about the plans that you left behind\nThe little white house by the railway line\nThe one we picked out\nWe even put the payment down\nWhat about the promise that you made\nTo stay with me till your dying day\nSaid you'd never go away\nAre they just things that people say\nAre they just things, baby?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c86eaacb3e081aa6e81716fb5b3c53c1.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lady Antebellum"}
