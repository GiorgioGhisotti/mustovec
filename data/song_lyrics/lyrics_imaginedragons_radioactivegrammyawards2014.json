YA! YA! YA!\n\n[Hook]\n\"Man down, where you from, nigga?\"\n\"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?\"\n\"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?\"\n\"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga\"\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nBrace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane\nThis is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine\nThis is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain\nNot the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain\nIt was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan\nYG Lucky ride down Rosecrans\nIt got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window \u2013 check yourself!\nUh, Warriors and Conans\nHope euphoria can slow dance\nWith society, the driver seat the first one to get killed\nSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out\nAt the same burger stand where *beep* hang out\nNow this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it\nBut ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different\nThat was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine\nPakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime\nPack a van with four guns at a time\nWith the sliding door, fuck is up?\nFuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?\nPickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers\nSuck a dick or die or sucker punch\nA wall of bullets comin' from\nAK's, AR's, \"Ayy, y'all, duck!\"\nThat's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch\nAw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose\nYou killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!\nNow crawl your head in that noose\nYou wind up dead on the news\nAin't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve\nBodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's\nObviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys\nWhen you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct\nMake sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect\nThey say the governor collect all of our taxes, except\nWhen we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat\nYou movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC\nGo buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess\nLets get It!\n\n[Hook]\n\"Man down, where you from, nigga?\"\n\"I said, where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?\"\n\"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga\"\n\n[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey'd probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I'm in the street, I say\u2014\nYA! YA! YA! YA!\n\n[Hook: Dan Reynolds]\nI'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones\nEnough to make my systems blow\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age\nWelcome to the new age, to the new age\n[YAWK! YAWK!
