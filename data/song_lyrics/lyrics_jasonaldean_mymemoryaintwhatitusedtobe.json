Oh, I don't know\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, lately my memory, ain't what it used to be at all\nIt's crazy, but holdin' you close to me, seein' you smile at me is all that I recall\n'Cause, baby, it don't matter how hard I try\nI still can't remember why we said goodbye\n\n[Verse 2]\nMaybe time's just playin' tricks on me these days\nOr maybe these old feelin's never went away\n'Cause all that I remember is I'm still in love with you\nAnd if I'm losin' my mind, I hope you are too\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, lately my memory, ain't what it used to be at all\nIt's crazy, but holdin' you close to me, seein' you smile at me is all that I recall\n'Cause, baby, it don't matter how hard I try\nI still can't remember why we said goodbye\n\n[Outro]\nIt's crazy, but holdin' you close to me, seein' you smile at me is all that I recall\n'Cause, baby, it don't matter how hard I try\nI still can't remember why we said goodbye\nWhy we said goodbye\nWhy did we say goodbye?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/97eceff7c74b8f07707fa79a9dd79287.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jason Aldean"}
