I'm fallin' in love\nI'm just an old hound dog\nRoamin' around, oh Lord\nI've got all this and Heaven above\n\nOh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'\nI'm comin' back to you one fine day\nNo need to worry, there ain't no hurry\nI'm on my way back to Georgia\nOn my way back to Georgia\n\nI get a feelin' when I remember\nWhen I remember all those crazy days and crazy nights\nGot the country music playin', you must've heard them singin'\nThey're gonna whip it out, and light up the night\n\nOh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'\nI'm comin' back to you one fine day\nNo need to worry, ain't in no hurry\nI'm on my way back to Georgia\nOn my way back to Georgia\n\nSame old place, same old city\nWhat can I do? I'm fallin' in love\nI'm just an old hound dog\nRoamin' around, oh Lord\nI've got all this and Heaven above\n\nOh, Atlanta, I hear you callin'\nI'm comin' back to you one fine day\nNo need to worry, ain't in no hurry\nOn my way back to Georgia\nOn my way back to Georgia\n\nOh Atlanta, I hear you callin'\nYeah I'm comin' back to you one fine day\nAin't in no hurry, no need to worry, no no\nI'm on my way back to Georgia\nOn my way back to Georgia\nOn my way back to Georgia\nOne more time\nOn my way back to Georgia", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de8dc7bdba4a45b09c8470cebc882878.224x224x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Eric Church"}
