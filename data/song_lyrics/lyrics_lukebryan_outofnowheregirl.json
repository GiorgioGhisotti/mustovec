Are you just here in town for the weekend\nAll of my life I've been here, never seen you before\nIf you need someone to show you around, girl I got you\nI gotta know you and hold you\nI don't wanna leave here alone anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nMy little light out of nowhere girl\nWhere you been all my life?\nWhere you been trying to hide?\nIt's like you come\nCome from another world\nFell right out of the sky\nAnd landed right here tonight\nDo you wanna dance with me?\nAny way you gotta be\nDo you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl\nI just wanna talk to you\nTell me what you wanna do\nYeah we gotta go somewhere\nMy little out of nowhere girl\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nWe could go anywhere you want\nBaby I got you\nYou know I got you\nWhen you walked in this place, you turned it up\nRight when I saw you\nBaby I saw you\n\n[Chorus]\nMy little light out of nowhere girl\nWhere you been all my life?\nWhere you been trying to hide?\nIt's like you come\nCome from another world\nFell right out of the sky\nAnd landed right here tonight\nDo you wanna dance with me?\nAny way you gotta be\nDo you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl\nI just wanna talk to you\nTell me what you wanna do\nYeah we gotta go somewhere\nMy little out of nowhere girl\n\n[Outro]\nMy out of nowhere girl\nMy out of nowhere girl\nOut of nowhere girl", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b361a936bd2a5d2f8a90d460513bb0b6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
