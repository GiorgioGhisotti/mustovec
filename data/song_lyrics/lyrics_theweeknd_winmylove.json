No\nEven if the baby is mine, you will never win my love, no\nYou will never win my... love, no\nEven if she needs my love, you'll never be sure. No\nOh no, not in love, not in love. No\nYou would seem real lonely\nNo reason. Oh\nNo reason, no\nEven if the baby is mine, you will never win my love, no\nYou will never get my love, no\nNo, everything you worked on for love, you will never get my love, no\nYou will never get my love, no, no, no, no baby", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3cd68c66d12d757c908ddbdcefb581e8.441x441x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Weeknd"}
