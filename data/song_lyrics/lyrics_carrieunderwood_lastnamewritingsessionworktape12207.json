What have I done?\"\nCause I don't even know his last name\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe left, the club, 'bout around three o'clock in the morning\nHis Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot\nIt should've been a warning\nI had no clue what I was getting into\nSo, I'll blame it on the Cuervo\nOh, where did my manners go?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I don't even know his last name\nOh, my momma would be so ashamed\nIt started off \"Hey, cutie, where you from?\"\nAnd then it turned into \"Oh, no! What have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know his last name\nHere we go!\n\n[Verse 3]\nToday, I woke up, thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas\nI'm not sure how I got here\nOr how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere\nI gotta go take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road\nHappens here\nStays here, all of this will disappear\n[Spoken: yeah, yeah, yeah, just one little problem\nOh that's right, yeah, yeah]\nWhat happens here stays here, all of this will disappear\nThere's just one little problem\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't even know my last name\nOh, my momma would be so ashamed\nIt started off \"Hey, cutie, where you from?\"\nAnd then it turned into \"Oh, no! What have I done?\"\nAnd I don't even know my last name\n\n[Outro]\nI don't even know my last name\nWoo!\n[Spoken: cool]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b2f2d732133e2539af4c0549a7d66641.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Carrie Underwood"}
