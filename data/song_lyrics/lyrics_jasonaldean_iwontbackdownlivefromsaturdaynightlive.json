This week we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history. Like everyone, I'm struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and heal. So many are hurting. There are children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends. They're all part of our family. So I wanna say to them: we hurt for you, and we hurt with you. But you can be sure that we're gonna walk through these tough times together every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit it's unbreakable\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I won't back down\nNo, I won't back down\nYou can stand me up at the gates of hell\nBut I won't back down\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo, I'll stand my ground\nWon't be turned around\nAnd I'll keep this world from draggin' me down\nGonna stand my ground\nAnd I won't back down\n\n[Chorus]\n(I won't back down)\nHey, baby, there ain't no easy way out\n(I won't back down)\nHey, I will stand my ground\nAnd I won't back down\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell I know what's right\nI got just one life\nIn a world that keeps on pushin' me around\nBut I'll stand my ground\nAnd I won't back down\n\n[Chorus]\n(I won't back down)\nHey, baby, there ain't no easy way out\n(I won't back down)\nHey, I will stand my ground\nAnd I won't back down\nHey baby, there ain't no easy way out\n(I won't back down)\nHey, I won't back down\n(I won't back down)\nHey, baby, there ain't no easy way out\n(I won't back down)\nHey, I will stand my ground\nAnd I won't back down\nNo, we won't back down", "image": "https://images.genius.com/99a2c7147380e6ceb1fdb4af3a69cfab.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jason Aldean"}
