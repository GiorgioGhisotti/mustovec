Yeah\n\n[Verse 4]\nDown where I was born, was heaven on earth\nThe Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt\nThe sun sets slow and the stars shine bright\nWhere I grew up, we rode in trucks", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f9b4416e4522e2120710012232c8be7c.321x311x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Luke Bryan"}
